I very occasionally sketch interesting things I see in the internet.

You will realise that the links are UUIDs, rather than representative
phrases. This is as such so that when I share the links, the element of
surprise will be preserved.

- [Olaf says hi](C38175264.jpg), based on Olaf from Frozen.
- [Pusheen](6A418EDE4.jpeg), based on [Pusheen the Cat 2017 Wall Calendar](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pusheen-2017-Wall-Calendar-Square/dp/1449478697)
- [A Cartoon Squirrel](https://twitter.com/fyquah95/status/721603733382037504), based on image I found online (I will cite when I find the original source)
