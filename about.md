I am a computer programmer, for the most part.  You will find that the content here
is likely going to revolve around:

- Computer programming tidbits (or link to my employer's blog)
- Public commitments / notes that I want written somewhere

I don't expect to write much. But I expect it to be non-zero a year from the
last part of this decade (it's 2026 when I make this claim).

The blog template is powered by Jekyll, and generated by Claude.
