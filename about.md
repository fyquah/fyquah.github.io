# About

My name is Fu Yong Quah. I am a computer programmer based in London, for the
most part. I also go by Stanislav.

You will find that the content here is likely going to revolve around:

- Computer programming
- Public commitments / notes

I don't expect to write much. But I expect it to be non-zero a year for the
last part of this decade (it's 2026 when I make this claim).

The blog is powered by Jekyll, and the template / theme is generated by Claude.
