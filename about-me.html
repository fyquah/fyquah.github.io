            I am Fu Yong, an ordinary boy from Penang, Malaysia. I am currently
            based in London, United Kingdom.

            I like understanding how things work and making them work in a simple
            manner. Things are not limited to mechanisms or software - I am
            more than happy to listen (and maybe argue) how cell replication
            would work, or how protein sysnthesis can be replicated in a in-vitro
            environment.

            I think I write program more than I talk to people. My favourite language
            (this has change at least twice in the last two years, but this one
            has stuck at least 5 months) is <b>clojure</b>. Reasons: Metaprogramming
            + (Kinda) Functional Programming. The satisfaction of writing a 
            general-purpose (i.e., functional) macro (i.e, metaprogramming) is 
            really good.

            I am a student at Imperial College London, reading Electronic
            and Information Engineering.
