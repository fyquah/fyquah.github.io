            <p><img src='/images/official_casual.jpg' style='width : 200px ; height: auto ; float: right ; margin: 10px'>I am a engineer-to-be who , definitely, loves engineering stuff. I am currently working on software-based projects and experimenting frameworks now and then. Grateful that I have started programming logic from a young age and subsequently , coding at a not-so-young-but-still-young-enough-la (Some Malaysian accent in there!) age.</p>
            <p>My primary interest (at least for now) resides in Web and Hardware integration. Programming preferences? I do ruby and javascript (but no node!) and some C++. I like these three languages specifically as they display great consistency throughout. While C++ might be a little inconsistent at times, it is largely due to the "abrupt" addition of OOP features, which I find pretty acceptable.</p>
            <p>I am an imperial college bound student, and will be studying electronic and information engineering. Previously, I have completed </p>
            <p>In the academic realm, I have a strong appeal towards science (physics in particular), computer science (algorithmic real-life problem solving) and statistical mathematics. Perhaps one day those can be integrated into my engineering projects? :)</p>
