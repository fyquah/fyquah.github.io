*I am fairly sure this has been academically discussed
in philosophy. Nevertheless, this is something that I have came
across so often that I thought it was worth writing about.*

Imagine you thought of the existence of an event, you assign
that event $$X$$ a probability $$p$$. The most straightforward
intepretation is to state that $$P(X) = p$$.

This is, unfortunately, a potentially disastrous mistake.

## A simple example

Imagine you secretly admire someone (an crush / long-time friend / 
secret idol / whatsoever).

One day you are on your way to work / school, and by change, you bump
into that person. You are a (very) happy human-being. Looking
back, you would realize that the odds of this happening was really
low. You make a fair estimate for the probability of this event
happening -- let's call this $$p_x$$.

Consider the alternative scenario: you wish to bump into that person
unexpectedly as part of (because of fate / weird quantum causality
theory) your daily routine. By doing some estimation and research,
you come up with a probability of this event happening, let's call it
$$p_y$$.

Do $$p_x$$ and $$p_y$$ refer to the same value?

## What?

I would argue that $$P(X) = p_x$$\* and $$P(X | the event happening) = p_y$$.
That is, simply by having thought the event's existence, you have
subconsicously chose a different probability value to estimate.

How can we circumvent such biases? This is a very classic example of
narrative fallacy - it helps to know that it exists, as we can make
measures to prevent cathostrophic consequences due to overconfidence
/ underconfidence in the probability of such events.

I believe expectation scenarios similar to the one presented above is
far more common than most of us would care to admit (myself included).

\* You can even go one step further argue that $P(X | event_has_happened_before) = p_x$,
but the key point here is that the sole thought of an event's existence
alters estimation results.
