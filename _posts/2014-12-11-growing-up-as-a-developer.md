title: Growing Up as a Developer
subtitle: 

excerpt: 

---

In almost 15 months of hacking around code, I am starting to grow up as a developer. In what sense? Several, but it is best expressed as a time line.

When I was 13, I started drag and drop programming. I was introduced to if-else conditions (duh) and subroutines. At that point, I was thinking programming is boring, not being able to render stuff but merely serving logic. Though, I had fun with robots, for a few years..

Fast forward, I am 18 years of age, went to my first Hackathon, got the urge of web development. Hence, I started learning javascript and PHP. (I dumped PHP later on). Finally, code that render things on the screen! I started writing web sites for fun, including one that strips some contents using some Facebook API to display as blog posts for a user. (The code was pretty bad, but that is a good start, considering I written code for only a month then).

I bumped into this thing called International Olympiad in Informatics, which sounds cool -- Code your way to the world. I signed up for my national selections, just to realize it was an 'algorithm' competition. I really did not know what was that, but the idea of computing appealed to me. However, turns out that it is a problem-solving computer science competition. I thought I have made a wrong decision to join, but I wanted to try something new. Looking back it was a critical decision, which is a first turning point in my life as a developer.

I didn't realize that at that point, though. Why would I want to solve weird looking problems (IOI have problems like, how do you calculate the winner's score in some weird game with weird rules, and each player plays 1million rounds)? Isn't Mathematics in school weird enough? Despite having a strong appeal for problem solving and mathematics, questions in the olympiad sometimes feels too strange to make any sense thinking about it. Part of me which like mathematics motivated me to do algorithmic questions now and then, but I start to see myself spend more time hacking around web development.

I ended up picking up Ruby on Rails (and Ruby, by the way, RoR is awesome). My (little) hardwork in algorithms did pay off some how, as subsequently, I was selected to participate in the IOI in the same year.

The sign of relief I had from finishing IOI was not having to see algorithm for some time and spend more time learning about web development, mainly Ruby on Rails. I brought back a good amoutn of knowledge in computer science, not knowing when will I ever use it in the near future. In the 2 months before travelling to London, I was left pondering with this question: "Solving strange computer science is pretty useless, isn't it ?"

When I attended Imperial College (in less than 2 months), I found the answer to my question: I was wrong.

## I was wrong

The truth is displaying something from a database and building a straightforward app is simple - anyone can do it.

On the large scale, to create something with engineering value, it goes down to computer science - having scientific magic behind a creation. For example, will creating a online marketplace for phones or font-recognizing algorithm contain more value?

Probably both (duh) have value, but in different forms. The marketplace has a *sales* value, whereas the algorithm has a *technical* value. As a developer, I am firm that the idea of creating something with *technical value* should be buried deep into ourselves. It doesn't matter if it brings cryptographic, security, machine-learing or architecture value, as long as it is a technical accomplishment.

# Realizing the Fact

I am (really really) content that I am discovering something that will potentially change my life as a developer. And I hope, reading this piece (if you are a developer) changes yours too. If you are reading this and turns out to be a programmer / developer, 

* **coded for some time -** If you are doing something with strong computer science concepts backing it, by all meanscontinue what you are doing. If you are writing code that retrieves data from the database day in day out, perhaps it is time to regain some new perspectives on projects.
* **you are a new coder -** I urge you to stop striving to learn all the possible languages in the world and start picking up computer science. By no means stop what you are doing, but learning those mathematics and algorithms will create true value in your projects, rather than apparent ones.
* **disagree with me**, I am open to discussion on this topic, drop me an email at **fuyong [at] fyquah.me**

To summarize, I believe it boils down to true technical value rather than normal pieces of code.
