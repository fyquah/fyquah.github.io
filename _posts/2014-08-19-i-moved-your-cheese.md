title: I Moved Your Cheese
subtitle: Thought on the book and living in a maze

excerpt: "A truly insightful and inspiring read to reflect on our everyday doings"

---

I often find it useful to just sit down and think about where I am standing (not physically standing, but rather my mental position). I bumped into this book and had one hour (without my computer, so I couldn't code, but oh well, I really appreciated having that one hour of break).

# Synopsis
## Introduction
Throughout the story, the author uses cheese and mice as metaphors for attractions and people. It is also emphasized that getting these cheese are getting harder day-by-day as they constantly moves around randomly. There turns out to be a good book, whose teachings is followed by a lot of mice, that remind mice to avoid thinking about the inevitable (that is, their cheese is moving around) and work on finding more cheese. In other words:

> You want cheese + cheese no longer here
> Go somewhere else to find cheese

in other words, work harder and stop questioning why towards the inevitable

<em>Cheese do look pretty neat I guess? No wonder mice are attracted to them</em>

However, things were slightly different for a few mice.

## Max
Max, was different. He was taught to find cheese to sustain life (like what is stated in the good book). The critical point was being able to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different'>think different</a>. Reaching his adolescence age, he, set with strong determination, ventured to seek out the secret behind the maze.

I will not discuss the specifications of the journey, but it took him some intelligence and help for Big to escape the maze, whose wall is 4-mouse-tall.

Learning, and venturing into the eccentric realm, he found out the secret of the cheese. He no longer asked "who moved my cheese", instead, he said "I moved your cheese".

## Zed
Zed was a quite and intelligent mouse. He is always approached by young mice for intellectual conversations, and never to be surprised by their topic of discussion. However, elderly dislike his thoughts, as they were against traditional ideas and opinions to long for cheese. The core value of Zed's thoughts resides in questioning "why". Believe me, it is easier said than done, especially when you go down to questiosn that cannot be answered just by common sense. (Simply because our common sense is no longer common or logical).

Things change when Zed met Max, who became good friends for a long time.

## Big
Big was different. While most mice strive to eat all cheese available, he ate just enough to sustain his health. As a result, he was strong and muscular. Every morning, he would jog around the maze, without actually feeling that it is a mze, and eat the amount of cheese he require.

Things were OKAY for a long time. Until things change, his "cheese" started moving. The maze's shape changed, rules changed in other words. It was a time of a change.

A hit on the way, and never was he back to the maze again.

# Personal Thoughts
I relate the story to hanging an apple in front of a donkey form its head. It will continue chasing the apple, without knowing why is he doing so, simply because he is blinded. Being blind is dangerous, especially when it is mental. Reading this book simply reminds me once again that I should be curious, as that is the back bone of engineering and people.

Personally, I thought that the book is worth a second read, third and forth ... (N reads in fact, where N >= 1 && N is a subset of R [nerdy as it sounds :)]). Revisiting the adventures of Max, Big and Zed every now and then will give me different insights and perspectives about life.
