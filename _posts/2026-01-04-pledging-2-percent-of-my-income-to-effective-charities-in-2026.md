title: "Pledging 2% of my Income to Effective Charities in 2026"
date: 2026-01-04

I have taken a pledge to donate at least 2% of my income to effective charities
in 2026, as part of [Giving What We Can's trial pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/members#lifetime-members-section).

This will be the first time I have done any kind of effective giving.

# Selfish Reasons to Give

There are a lot of reasons to do this for the good of the world, but I will give
the selfish altruism angle. The thing that really swayed me towards taking this
seriously is reading the possible impact of **effective** donation. It made me
feel warm and good. For example, GiveWell estimates that it costs [around
$3,500 - $5,500 in 2022-2024 to save a
life](https://www.givewell.org/impact-estimates#Impact_metrics_for_grants_to_GiveWells_top_charities).

Ultimately, doing good feels good, and it's probably easier to sustain being an
altruist if it's an act I enjoy. I have gotten Gemini to explain [why impure
effective altruism is good, in fact a sustainable form of
giving](https://gemini.google.com/share/712c86cef103).

# The Case for Doing it Publicly

The gist of it is commitment and spreading the act of giving as a cultural
norm. As mentioned above, it's relatively cheap to have high impact, as long as
the giving is incredibly effective. There are of course some reasons not to -
privacy and virtue signalling.

Weighing the pros and cons, I think writing it in a publicly-visible blog post
sounds like the right balance to me personally, even though I generally
consider myself a relatively private person.  If a peer ends up reading this
and donates even $5,000 to save 1 life, over the course of the lifetime of this blog,
the cost to personal privacy and potential virtue signalling is definitely
worthwhile.

Giving What We Can
has written extensively on [why one should do this publicly](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/why-pledge).

# What am I donating to?

I am still figuring this out -- all this is new to me, and I intend to write
more about this once I do. I have started with some immediately beneficial
health initiatives, especially in the light of [USAID cuts](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/update-lives-lost-usaid-cuts). My best guess is a
good mix of immediately impactful short-medium term health and long-tail AI safety
initiatives, but this will very likely change.
