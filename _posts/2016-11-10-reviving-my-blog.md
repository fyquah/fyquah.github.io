title: Reviving My Blog
subtitle: I have stopped writing for quite a while.

excerpt: A really practical lesson on how to keep a personal momentum going.

---

Almost two years ago, I have promised myself to use blogging as a means of writing on interesting
interesting things. This would allow me to:

1. Keep track of my progress in gaining knowledge
2. Impose some sense of discipline on myself.
3. Have somewhere to refer when I need a quick solution to something that I had figured out before. (eg: Deploying rails - I still use that blog post reasonably frequently)

I broke the promise (Oops) and I intend to fix it. Following my decision to reduce facebook usage (i.e: I am only using facebook to add new friends / remove people I don't know / get event tickets), blogging (and twitter, which is a medium for microblogging) will be my only means of sharing my knowledge and thoughts. I intend to write more about "getting rid of facebook from my life" at some point - but I do not have enough data / personal experience to write about just yet.

In part, the reason that I didn't blog a lot was the difficulty in "building" my blog due to the abundant javascript / CSS / gems / weird assets in my github pages "stack". Given that I now have nothing but a really really simple and plain site, there is no reason to impose myself on such a painful stack. I have made my Gemfile simple to the extend that github pages can build it on its own. Hopefully, this will make me start blogging again.

A lot have happened  in my life during the months (or year?)that I have not blogged, but the highlights are:

- I interned in google, working with [pytype](https://www.github.com/google/pytype)
- I wrote a self-hosting C compiler. I feel great satisfaction as I wrote a big C project and wrote a compiler
- I indulged myself in studying machine learning topics, specifically reinforcement learning and statistical bayeisian inference. I intend to write about those topics on a regular basis (~ once every three weeks?) as some form of "revision / self-review"
- I have recently been to web summit 2016. Got some pretty cool idea refreshers (and enjoyed some Lisbon night life)
- I am an avid vim user now! (This is probably since ~ August 2015). Thanks to my friends at Netcraft during my internship who convinced me to use this wonderful text editor.
- I am on a typing-accuracy fixing adventure! While I can go on roughly 102 WPM consistently, my error rate is roughly 4% (That is terrible ...). I will write more about this when I have some results. I have collected some data before I try some methods to fix my typing, so stay tuned.
- I am becoming a [FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) nerd. My latest project was to implement Convolutional Neural Networks on Maxeler's FPGA HLS platform.

All in all, I intend to keep this space updated in the near and distant future.
