title: On Why I Almost Never Use Loyalty Cards
subtitle: 

excerpt: 

---

Almost any shop (food stores, grocery chains etc.) have some form of loyalty
program, in which you are given a rewards.

On hindsight, it looks like a pure win for consumers, since the increased
competition and ease of usage (loyalty cards in smartphones), 

But I don't think so. Here's why

- the paper loyalty cards take up space in my wallet.
- the app loyalty cards require me to download an app, and carry my phone
  around (which i don't always)
- my choices are artifiically constrained
- I have one extra thing to look at (my "loyalty" points), which takes away
  a fraction of my attention.
- I have to think about optimizing my points usage

In a world where time is free. But it's not. In most parts of the world, time
and attention is expensive. Many such loyalty programs (and social networks for
that matter) managed to shadow this fact from consumers for a small price of a
10 dollars in discounts per year. \*

There are exceptions, of course. If there's a big sparodic purchase with
some form of loyalty program, then perhaps, since in those cases i'd be
paying a small amount of time / attention currency in returns of big
monetary savings. *(it's unclear why such thing would exists, since
such entities won't require on such marginal edges in a oligarchy market)*.
