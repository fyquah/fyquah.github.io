title: "Pledging 2% of my Income to Effective Charities in 2026"
date: 2026-01-03

I have taken a pledge to donate at least 2% of my income to effective charities
in 2026, as part of [Giving What We Can's trial pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/members#lifetime-members-section).
This will be the first time I have done any kind of effective giving.

# Selfish Reasons to Give

There are a lot of reasons to do this for the good of the world, but I will
give the selfish altruism angle. The thing that really swayed me towards taking
this seriously is reading the possible impact of **effective** donation. Almost
as important as knowing how much better it made the world, was that it made me
feel warm and good having made the donation. For example, GiveWell estimates
that it costs [around $3,500 - $5,500 in 2022-2024 to save a
life](https://www.givewell.org/impact-estimates#Impact_metrics_for_grants_to_GiveWells_top_charities).

Doing impactful good feels good, and it's probably easier to sustain being an
altruist if it's an act I enjoy.  I have gotten Gemini to explain [why impure
effective altruism is a good, and in fact sustainable, form of
giving](https://gemini.google.com/share/712c86cef103).

# The Case for Doing it Publicly

Reasons to do it publicly: 

- commitment to giving
- spreading the act of giving as a cultural norm.

Reasons to do it privately:

- retaining privacy
- avoiding virtue signalling

Weighing the pros and cons, I think writing it in a publicly-visible blog post
personally sounds like the right balance. If people I know end up cumulatively
donate even $5,000 to save 1 life, as a result of reading this, over the course
of the lifetime of this blog, the cost to personal privacy and potential virtue
signalling is definitely worthwhile.

Giving What We Can
has written extensively on [why one should do this publicly](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/why-pledge).

# What am I donating to?

I am still figuring this out -- all this is new to me, and I intend to write
more about this once I do. I have started with some immediately beneficial
health initiatives, especially in light of [USAID cuts](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/update-lives-lost-usaid-cuts).
