As a kid I have always dreamed on being an engineer. It didn't really matter back then whatever field it is in, I just want to make sure I am a creator, innovator and maker, which , back then,  summarizes the core characteristics of a good engineer.

I grew old to realize that engineering is beyond that. It is backed by true brilliance. While the characteristics are still the core of a good engineer, the brilliance actually lies in Mathematics and science. Taking Taipei 101 as a good example:

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/taipei-101.jpg"></div>
<em>Pretty neat huh</em>

Little do we know, the tower is actually backed by an engineering brilliance (the grammar may be a little off, but I prefer to phrase it this way)

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/taipei-101-pendulum.jpg"></div>
<em>The maths and science supporting the high-rise tower</em>

So what makes this interesting? Little do we know, this is a simple application of several scientific principles, namely <strong>Simple Harmonic Motion</strong> , <strong>Moments of Intertia</strong> and <strong>Torque</strong>. Google those up if the appeal to you. The big damper ball (its actual name) was a critical factor ensuring the tower's stability, as portrayed in the 2013 Taipei incident. Its <a target='_blank' href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohKqE_mwMmo'>oscillation</a> prevented it from collapsing by varying its position, hence canceling off the moment caused by the earth quake.

Perhaps it wasn't clear back then, but those <em>engineer's insistence of having the pendulum displayed publicly</em> actually make sense! 


Implementations of engineering brilliance are, while not easy to spot, actually around us every day. For example, <a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla'>Nikola Tesla</a>, the man behind AC current; Larry Page, creator of PageRank algorithm(the back bone of Google search engine). I can go on and on, but I prefer to sum up with one sentence.

<p style="text-align : center"><strong>In a nutshell</strong></p>
> Engineering is awesome. Period.
