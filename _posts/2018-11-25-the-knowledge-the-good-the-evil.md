title: The Perills of Fundamental Values - the Ill-Defined Good and Evil
subtitle: 

excerpt: 

---

What you will not find here is not a highly cited report based on previous
studies on this subject. I have finite amount of time, and all I wish to do
is share my views in the world. You are free to disagree with them, since
alas, it's just one man's view of the world.

Instead of trying to interleave my arguments with my supporting examples /
observations from the world, I will describe all my main arguments, and
segment my supporting examples and elaboration later section.

## Main Argument

### Arguments

- Logical axioms are necessary in philosophising, scienc-ing, writing policies,
  and anything really. I cannot disagree about you with many of the
  propositions (as long as it is logical constructed), but I _can_ disagree
  with you about your choice of axioms.

- All "fundamental views" about the views are axioms (especially when I say
  I truly believe that bla bla bla). Everything that follows (rule of
  governence at all scales) are proportion that assumes.

- With the absence of fundamental views, good and evil no longer exist.
  There is onlt expected behaviour (the good), an unexpected deviation from
  an expected behaviour (the evil) or a deviation in an uncorrelated /
  orthogonal axis (the "oh this is a different thing that I am willing to
  accept")

- All good and evil a truly social constructs. It has been a work of humans
  to attempt to find social constructs that will organise us well. If you
  disagree with someone (be it an individual, or a norm), it is likely that
  none of you are right.

- Attempting to argue about what's fundamentally "correct" is very often a
  lose-lose scenario. Assuming both parties have got their logical
  deriviations correct and hold their fundamental views firmly, we will
  arrive at a disagreement about axioms. Axioms cannot be proven /
  disprovens, and hence, noone will always be "right". (At which point,
  the best solution will be to agree to disagree).

### Interesting Corollaries

**Debates and arguments** should follow a vaguely systematic process:

1. check if anyone have derive any propositions incorrectly.
2. check if anyone of your axioms are independently contradictory.
   Clauses in a well-formed set of axioms are orthogonal / independent.
3. check if both of your axioms 
4. Agree to disagree OR if you _have_ to make a decision, find out which
   attempt to take an action that relies only on a common subset of axioms.
5. If (4) is taking too long (give yourself a time budget), fallback to
   Lindy-proven decision-making heuristics, such as
   [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

**We all see the world differently**. For most part, it is best to attempt
to see through someone's logical axioms by sampling a large set of actions.

**This text**, on its own, despite attempting to be really rigorous, is
based on the assumption that logic is well-defined (which in turn, relies
on a small set of logical axioms).

The text that follows are simply supporing examples / evidence / slightly
more rigorous elaboration.  Feel free to skip them, should you think that
the arguments above are not woth your time.

## Supporting Text

### Making the World a "Better" Place

### Liberty, "Fundamental" Human Rights

At this day of age, it is uncommon to think of liberty as a fundamental
right. Despite the existence of various supporing evidence (the failure of
Nazi Germany and communism in Nazi Germany and Vannenzula to achieve
it's essential goal of wealth distribution), the only real thing I can claim
is that "Socialism does not necessarily acheive its intended goal of wealth
distribution". It is tempting to assume that economical liberty and free
markets to be the "right way" not just to grant equality in wealth
redistribution and opportunities, but not to cause massive masse.
Does freedom feel better for majority of the population? Probably. It
is possible that freedom is a common axiom amongst human beings. Despite
this possibility, we cannot assume that freedom is a fundamental human right,
unless we can present a logical, complete and sound proof that all human
beings are biologically coded to long for freedom and liberty. All we have
are empirical observations via history and experiments. At the end of the
day, empirical observations are not rigorous, and it is almost impossible
to dervie a logical causal relation (a statistical causal relation, however,
is possible, using tools like $r^2$ values, but alas isn't rigorous) that
led to the said observation.

Yes, just because we believe something is engrained in our biology, doesn't mean that
it is "fundamentally correct", for 2 reasons. (1) It might even be biologically
engrained in our brain, consider a simple thought experiment: imagine getting
the entire population. We can probably never prove that a
biologically-engrained property is ubiqutous amongst all humans, but we
can easily prove the inverse with a single counter example. This is simply a
paraphrase of [the black swan problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory)
and [apophatic theology / via negativa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophatic_theology)
(2) Even if we prove that it is biologically engrained in ourselfs, it
does not mean that it is an exisential fact. Evolution (I am assuming
evolution is true) is a dynamic process - it changes over time. Even so,
it probably happens at a different rate in different subpopulations. What
that is true now, is not necessarily biologically true. Truth that changes
over time is not exisential and fundamental. This extents to principle that
we think we love and cherish, such as economical liberty and huamn rights.
If it were something that has been existential, why did hierachical
organisations (as early as the agriculture) exist?

## Terorrism, "Evil" Destruction

Ev

That said, terrorism is not something I can tolerate with. My main argument
here is that it is logically incorrect to argue that
"Terrorism is fundamentally incorrect", but it is appropriate to
say "I dislike terrorism, as it is inconsistent with my axioms". It is
important to see the distinction -- just because at a set point in time,
a disproprotionate number of people (the entire populus) share a set of
common axiom, it does not grant that axiom an oracle status.

### A Mathematical Overview


## Who are You to Say All This?

I am a nobody. I am going to die one day, along with my view of the world.
As I disclaimed earlier on, feel free to disagree.

Does this challenge everything you believed to be true in your whole life?
It might. It did, partially, when I got this realisation. It is only when
I attempt to put everything in words where I accepted that what I thought
was true was simply what I _believed_ to be true. I will still behave as if
I have never had this revelation, the main difference being that I get
much less emotionally attached to things that I used to believe were true.

The next time someone says "X is true", interpret it as that person as
saying "I believe X is true", then decide if you have the same subset of
logical axioms to lead to proposition X.
