title: Bullshit with Authority
subtitle: A presentation technique with brings me several thoughts

excerpt: Bullshitting calls for some citation, which automagically makes it non bullshitting! (because you are relying on true facts)

---

Today as I attended my last GHTC Toastmasters meeting of the year, I delivered my CC8. I gotta admit that I was not too prepared and had lots of flaws, with the major one being not citing sources. My evaluator did point that out, and claim the the term philosopher *(which i had used very often in my speech)* is too general and vague. I learnt a lot from that evaluation, thanked him sincerely , but that very one statement hangs in my mind along my 30-minute drive back home.

>> Bullshit with Authority

Let's analyze the statement word by word.

## Bullshit

It simply means you are talking something which does not make sense. For example: *I can jump 100 storeys from the building without suffering from a single injury*. That makes no sense right?

While it is pretty crappy, I have witnessed this statement a lot in modern advertisements! For example, we have computers boasting that it "auto-comes-out-from-sleep" in 2 seconds. It indeed does, but only before you install those crappy software.

## with

Just another preposition :)

## Authority

It means your facts are true, backed by the correct sources. In technical terms, it is called citation.

# Putting them together

IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!!

* **Bullshit** means it makes no sense
* **Authority** means it makes sense

While it doesn't seem to add up, the truth is they do. A lot of the times,  the way we phrase a sentence will influence the amount of impact on the listener and the degree of believe. Mastering the skill of BwA (Bullshit with Authority) simply maximizes both factors.

Let me rephrase some sentences above:

## Sentence 1

I jumped from the atmosphere of the earth, and managed to reached the surface without a single scratch. It is written in the Gusiness World Record as the highest jump attempted successfully by man.

This sounds way more convincing than the one under the bullshit header. There is citation, Gusiness World Record. Although it sounds crazy, the guy who makes this statement left out some important points that will unimpress you. Nevertheless, leaving out points can something bring you higher.

NOTE:

THE ABOVE SENTENCE WAS NOT BY ANY MEANS SAID BY THE ACHIEVER, I SIMPLY MADE IT UP TO ILLUSTRATE MY POINT.

## Sentence 2

Our records from our labotory statistics, with constantly Quality control, have provided accountable observations that our fresh laptops were able to survive crashes up to 5 meters tall and can boot within 2 seconds from any state.

The sentence speaks for itself, statistics are always powerful. But vauge statistics can be more powerful, if you didn't manage to identify any:

* If fresh laptop can boot in 2 seconds, how bout non fresh ones?
* What are the chances of surviving the 5 meter tall?

# In a Nutshell

Sometimes it matters more about how I convey a message then what the happenings actually were. While I have learnt new presentation technique / tactic, I was once again left pondering: 

**Are and observations around us the truth, or simply vague representations of the actual happenings?**

Some philosopher I am ... :)
