excerpt: "The reason behind me taking up blogging"

---

I have never been serious about blogging (hopefuly I am this time). My reluctancy to do so are motivated by a few reasons:

* I can't really find a blogging platform which is cool (Wordpress and blogspot are not my cup of tea)
* Can't see the purpose behing doing so
* Laziness and procrastination

Things chaged in merely a day.

I bumped into this this ruby gem called <strong>jekyll</strong> , which is more superior than wordpress in countless of ways:

* It is basically a static site, so you don't really need a language parser
* I can use sublime text to write blogs (as I use HTML tags and javascript here and there)
* It is in Ruby. nuff said

Well, maybe blogging is a lot more fun with jekyll. Then soon I realized something. 

<em>When was the last time I wrote an essay?</em>

<strong>When I was applying for university (8 months ago)</strong>

Not writing stuff <em>Is Bad</em> and my verbal presentation skills might detoriate. 

If that is not bad enough, <em>the last time I actually make an effort to write down about my experience was.. </em>

<strong>A year and a half ago, when I attended a two-week training camp.</strong>

Crap, now that I have only the slightest memory, if not none, of past happenings. The procrastination is bad, like really really bad. Time for a change. Let's go back to the list again

* I can't really find a blogging platform which is cool (Wordpress and blogspot are not my cup of tea) <strong style='color: blue'><em>But jekyll is</em></strong>
* Can't see the purpose behing doing so <strong style='color: blue'><em>I now do</em></strong>
* Laziness and procrastination <strong style='color: blue'><em>This no longer holds with the top two fulfilled</em></strong>

It does not really matter if anyone reads the blog or not, but I guess this will be a good practice and substitute to writing diaries.

Now, time for some serious blogging!
