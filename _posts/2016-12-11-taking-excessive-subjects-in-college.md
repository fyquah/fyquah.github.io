Three months ago, I have decide to take more subjects than I should (and required to) for the autumn semester in my third year (also known as junior year in american schools). This post is to document my experience and thought on doing this.

Why write this now? This is exactly a day before my exams. I recokn writing this entry now would remove a large extend of subjective bias based on my performance in my examination.

## But why?

Often get asked - why did I do this in the first place? The only reason I am doing this is because my interest (and curiousity, given that some subjects are things that I have not seen before) in the subjects available this semester is significantly stronger than those avilable in the spring semesters. To be more specific, out of roughly 13 choices avilable each semester, I like 7-8 from this semester and maybe only 1 or 2 next semester. After a selection process, I ended up with 6 this semester and 1 for the next.

I wasn't even trying to unbalance things on purpose. I simply end up with this configuration after selecting subjects that I like.

## Understanding the Material

- Attending lectures regularly would probably have helped. I am guilty for not doing that. Sometimes I simply screw up, whereas sometimes there are clashes in my timetable. Either way, I end up having to panopto (view video recordings of lectures) or studying the materials myself.
- It is farily straightforward to understand the basic materials of a lecture.
- Even if you have to skip a lecture, the amount of time required to understand lecture is roughly <= the length of the lecture.
- In short, this wasn't a problem.

## Coursework

- exercise-based coursework: I didn't find this to be too much a problem (in terms of time-scheduling). Coursework tend to help me understand materials better, so doing them eventually go into my revision time.
- practical-based coursework: Oh gawd. These things are the best things to happen in course like this, as you get to play with things that actually work. In my case, it was a robotics coursework. It was a fun coursework, except that it took up roughly 5 full-days of my term in total.
- Only 4 of my subjects had courseworks and only 1 of them is practical-based.
- While I'd love some of the subjects to have more practical work, I can't imagine myself managing my time with all those.

## Understanding beyond the Required Materials

- At times, the lecture would go through an interesting topic that I really wish that I delve into further (with some code or additional reading) right after the lecture (at the same evening).
- Unfortunately, there is usually something going on (lectures to catch up, coursework).
- While I could blame time, I would put a decent amount of blame on myself for not jotting all these interesting topics down so that I can go through them when I have some spare free time.
- There are not a lot of free time (26 hours of lectures a week), there is still a reasonable amount. But they are somewhat scattered.
- i.e: You get a decent amount of "one-hour" breaks but very few "free-days". I usually spend those time doing tutorials, as they are easy to context-switch away from.
- In short, this is tough. Pulling this off required some degree of discipline, or you'd end up spending too much time doing it. or you might also end up spending insufficient time doing it that doesn't justify the context-switch / subject divergence.
- Personally, I notice that I have wrote substantially less amount of code compared to the last two terms in my school, so that probably says something about me spending time to understand extended materials.
- I did manage to study a few things to a certain extent (gaussian processes), but I really wished that I could have studied way more.

## Social Life

Haha. Hahahahaha. Please don't tell me you are even thinking about it.

(Though, I did manage to grab a couple of drinks with my friends and had some meals with my family at the beginning of the term.)

## Extra-Curicullar

- It is hard to commit to anything, simply because you are not sure when will you have to work on coursework or do catch-up reading.
- I end up doing a decent amount of scattered things (playing badminton ocassioanlly and attend talks on Machine learning), but it tough to commit myself to something long-term.
- At the autumn term, another thing to worry about is placement applications and interview. (I am required to do a industrial placement as part of the 3rd year of my course)
- I travelled to Lisbon for a week during the Autumn term. It was a fun trip, except for the part that I have 3 courseworks and a week of lecture to catch up after the trip.
- The worst part? Catching up with lectures and coursework eventually went on all the way to the last few weeks of term, when I had to start preparing for my exams.
- In short, extra-curicullar life would be a little screwed for awhile, unless you are prepared to do some self-studying after missing a series of lectures.
- On the flip side, I have a decent amount of time to do anything I want next term.


## Exams

Surprisingly (or unsurprisingly for some), preparing for exams was one of the easiest things to do. There are reasonable amount of resources , such as past papers and tutorials, to make sure that we are reasonably prepared for the examinations.

It doesn't take a tremendous amount of time to get familiar with the structure of examinations. The only issue that bugs me is the confusion of notation between overlapping subjects. For example, PBH-testing uses `s * lambda - A| B` whereas calculating eigenvalues uses `A - lambda I`. I sometimes get both of these confused.

## Final thoughts?

I am glad that I made this decision:

- I got to do the subjects that I am interested in trying out.
- I did, somewhat, survive it.
- The subjects in my third year are still somewhat "introductory subjects" rather than "research-heavy subjects", so learning many things superficially still didn't harm my learning too muhch.

Will I do it again? Looking through the subjects that I am interested in studying for my final year, they are evenly-distributed throughout the 2 terms.So, I guess not.
