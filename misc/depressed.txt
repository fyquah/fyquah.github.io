Most (all?) notes have some form of unease in it. I write them when I feel
like shit, to un-shit-ify myself. Read at your own peril.


Feb 2018 - Uncertainty promotes anxiety; Certainty yields pointlessness; The
           middle causes both.

Feb 2018 - Choices imply regret. Accumulated regret results in
           persistent unease.

Jan 2018 - Competency vs happiness - is it not possible to have both?

Dec 2017 - Quantifiably well, but quanlifiably unwell. There are more things
           to life that are defined by numbers. (but it is always hard to
           convince those who've not experienced the weight of all those
           numbers. Eg: Imagine a millionaire telling a beggar "money isn't
           everything"; or a 4.0 student telling a border-line student that
           study isn't everything).

Dec 2017 - Depression is real. It is not something you can just "get well
           by thinking positively". Fuck social stigma against depression.

Nov 2017 - It is funny how most people think that "we've got it all sorted
           out"

Nov 2017 - Rational decisions ~= unhappy short-term decisions, probably
           satisfying-ish long term decisions.

Oct 2017 - The harsh realisim is that nothing is ever enough -- humans are
           greedy to have more (quantitatively or qualitatively).

August 2017 - I never thought having social interaction and company is a
              human necessity.

July 2017 - I am just stupid.
