            <p>I am a engineer-to-be who , definitely, loves engineering stuff. I am currently working on software-based projects and experimenting frameworks now and then. Grateful that I have started programming logic from a young age and subsequently , coding at a not-so-young-but-still-young-enough-la (Some Malaysian accent in there!) age. My primary interest (at least for now) resides in Web and Hardware integration. Programming preferences? <strong>Ruby</strong> For the win man.</p>
            <p>A Cambridge A-Levels Student at INTI College Penang , I am currently studying science. In the academic realm, I have a strong appeal towards science (physics in particular), computer science (algorithmic real-life problem solving) and statistical mathematics. Perhaps one day those can be integrated into my engineering projects? :)</p>
            <p>I classify stuff into only two categories : <em>engineering</em> and <em>non-engineering</em></p>
